MITx 15.071x The Analytics Edge - Homework Assignments
====


This repo allows me to save and keep track of my progress in this MIT MOOC about Data Sciences and Machine Learning Techniques.

It contains all the homework assignments to do after each unit.

I won't be certified at the end of this MOOC because I joined it (and discovered it) 1 week after it was over.
